# Falso Ídolo

Falso Ídolo is a record label in **Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia** where I've worked as a session musician and freelance developer.

You can check out the site at : www.falsoidolo.com.

I collaborated with a dear friend Álex Perez [@AlexPerzap] (https://github.com/AlexPerzap/). 

We used HTML5, CSS(Flexbox).

Currently I am devoloping the e-commerce and e-learning portal.
